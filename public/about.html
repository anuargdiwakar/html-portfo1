<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey Geeks I'm a full time Spiderman half time son, friend, brother and so on.
  I was a full time student when my classes was half of the week , then i meet a person who tell me that there is lots
of ways to get rich and he tell me one of the way by inviting me to a seminal. 
There my Network marketing path stars from, and after getting 1year of experience of this business i got another oppuritinity 
from my senior of college as well as in NM business.</p>

<p>
  Then our Real Business Related work starts by ending up our Nm path and it was a critical path for us because we were 
  extremly motivated and immature in the world of real business or i can say traditional business. But we made a by ourself 
  in 6 weeks which generates 60k-80k sales in a month but because of poor finance methods or mearsures we were doomed so we 
  decided to stop this business and promise to ourself that when we have a good amount of money(100k-150k) in our hand we 
  will start our business once again.  
</p>

<p>
  Then the problem arrises where we can earn 100k-150k in 6-8 months so me starts what we were doing before starting NM,
  it was coding , we are praparing ourself to get projects by freelanceing it is the best way to make ourself skillful 
  as well as earn by it to once again to enter the game of business.
